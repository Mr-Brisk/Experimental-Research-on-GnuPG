# Experimental-Research-on-GnuPG
The acceleration in the advance of web communication has leads to extension growth of the data privacy risks and increase in the vulnerability of the data. Cryptography is an indispensable in computer communication, due to the online privacy concerns our data is not safe without encryption. Zimmerman invented the PGP encryption standard, where it is then implemented as GPG - an Opensource. It gives the effective solution for the secure email communication Here, I have discussed about its function, its RSA computation by taking Libgcrypytâ€™s, and its Historical changes by fixing the vulnerabilities.
